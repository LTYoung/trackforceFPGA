# TrackForceFPGA
A reference utility that can be used either in motorsport or automotive development purposes, down to the precise milliseconds
# What is this?
TrackForce is a Embedded & FPGA project that intergrates an IMU and a GPS module to provide real time speed (km/h) and G force readouts for vehicles.

# Required Hardware
1. Digilent Zybo Z7-20 Board
2. Sparkfun u-blox NEO-M9N GPS Module (Other antenna types acceptable)
3. Adafruit BNO08x IMU
4. Arduino Nano 

# Required Tools
1. AMD Xilinx Vivado 2023.2
2. AMD Xilinx Vitis Unified IDE 2023.2

# Strcture of the repo
1. `.vscode`: VScode settings mainly for the arduino sketches in utilities
2. `trackforce.vitis` Vitis Project Folder. 
    1. `app_component`: application component of track force. You can find the source code in `src`
    2. `platform`: hardware platform component, generated using `.xsa` file exported from Vivado. 
    3. Other folders and files generated by Vitis Unified IDE
3. `trackforce.vivado`: Vivado Project Folder.
    1. `trackforce.srcs`: contains the Verilog source of the PL.
    2. `trackforce.sims`: contains the testbenches used for most of the non-trivial modules.
    3. Other folders and files generated by the Vivado Design Tool.
4. `utilities`: contains arduino sketches
    1. `gpstest`: a test sketch to test the UART interface and its parsing of NMEA messages
    2. `imuDriver`: a utility sketch that helps to extract X, Y data from the IMU and forward to the board over UART.
5. `TrackForce_EC551_FinalProject.pptx`: Final presentation of this project used during Boston University EC 551 Course in Fall 2023 Semster.
6. `README.md`: This file
